COMPILING ON WIN32/WIN64 WITH VISUAL C++ 2013/2015 COMMUNITY EDITION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Download and install the Visual C++ 2013/2015 Community Edition.

2. Download and install the DirectX SDK (June 2010) here:
	http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812

3. Download and install MFC multibyte update https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40770 (MSVC 2013 only)

4. Download and install the latest CMake.

5. Generate the MSVC projects using CMake by doubleclicking a matching configuration .bat file in the neo/ folder.

6. Open generated solution, choose solution config (Release, Debug, etc.) and build it

NOTE: both stack sizes in the Linker options need to be set to 16Mb (16777216) to be able to compile massive maps with 32bit dmap

RUNNING ENGINE ON WIN32/WIN64
-----------------------------

1. Copy StormEngine2.exe into a FolderOfYourChoice/

2. Copy base/ folder into FolderOfYourChoice/ where you copied StormEngine2.exe previously

3. Run StormEngine2.exe

Note: legal screen is disabled in debug builds. Intro video can be skipped by pressing a key, a gamepad button or moving mouse in any build.

BASE ASSETS PACKAGE (for testing)
-----------------------------

Base assets package is offered by Yuizaki from idTech4 discord (a mix of Phaeton assets, Yuizaki's assets and assets made by other community member(s) ):

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cyR_csyeDTdZvy2DMIOWG3aQ7aW5h52I?usp=sharing

Note: Commercial use prohibited. Please provide credit if you are going to use these assets in your projects.

OVERALL CHANGES AND ADDITIONAL FEATURES 
--------------------------------------
(in addition to existing set of features of the original engine)

- Flexible build system using CMake

- Linux support (32 and 64 bit)

- Win64 support (including Win64 tools)

- OpenAL Soft sound backend primarily developed for Linux but works on Windows as well

- PNG screenshots support

- Soft shadows using PCF hardware shadow mapping

- True 64 bit HDR imaging

- Soft (feathered) particles

- Gloss maps support

- Oblique view frustum (for proper reflections in the water)

- High resolution RoQ videos playback

- Blurry real-time reflections

- Image based bloom ("glow")

- Image dithering (eliminates banding artifacts on gradients)

- Underwater view warping

- Material flag to force images to be kept in RGBA format (unocmpressed)

- Full set of built-in tools for Win32/Win64 platforms (with various fixes and improvements)

- envShot cmd to generate cubemaps

- Higher quality YCoCg "scaled" DXT5 compression for diffuse images (from GIMP DDS)

- YCoCg "scaled" DXT 5 compression for skyboxes and cubemaps (yields high quality skies with minimal artifacts and no banding)

- Demo recording and playback

- LOD for static and animated entities (although not for map brushes)

- Mods loading and packaging into .resources

- Wheeled Vehicles (player driven and self-driving)

- Automatic overwrite of outdated binary files when auto-authoring updated content

- Fixed inlining (embedding) of static meshes into .proc while retaining collisions

- Map loading progress indicator

- Texure compression progress indicator

- Collision fix for large coordinates

- noSpecular option for lights now works (fill lights should use it to avoid unnecessary specular highlights)


KNOWN ISSUES
------------

- DoomScript debugger doesn't quite work in 64bit build

A WISHLIST OF FEATURES (to be added to the engine by some programming wizard :) )
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- ~~Fix vehicles (savegame crash fix; networking)~~
- 8-way texture blending using vertex colors with transition masking using height maps
- Equirectangular skybox (in addition to existing 6-image cubemaps)
- Refine LOD solution (make it a bit more performant; add support for skeletal meshes)
- Distance culling (not render meshes past certain distance) 
- Foliage shader with simple wind deformations (including using vertex color to anchor mesh and create gradient rigidity) 
- Mesh instancing for static meshes (kinda like ISM/HISM in UE4)
- AAS on meshes (to be able to have navigation built on mesh terrains)
- Save/load game multithreading (to eliminate hiccups/freezes when performing saving/loading in-game)
- Improve Lights Editor to allow spawning/deleting/moving/saving lights in-game
- DoomScript nativization (optional, to improve performance)
- Reverb zones (XAudio2 supports reverb afaik)
- Native multiplayer coop
- Headless dedicated server
- Master server app
- Improve shadowmapping (particularly cascaded shadowmaps on huge levels)
- Replace current texture compressor with fast BC7 compressor
- Replace all legacy OpenGL 1.x stuff with OpenGL 3.3 (or whatever base standard is nowadays)
- Parallax-corrected cubemap reflections (with support for equirectangle textures; or better yet reflection capture entities)
- SSAO
- Light shafts
- Good looking and (relatively) fast POM shader with self-shadowing
- Volumetric fog supporting shadows
- Replace SWF renderer with SVG renderer


AUTHORING OF BITMAP FONTS
-------------------------

Generation of new bitmap fonts is somewhat convoluted process, no thanks to Doom 3 BFG engine. To be able to generate engine compliant bitmap fonts, please follow instructions below. The process used to work smoothly back in the days and hasn't been tested in 2021.

Download BFGFont app (based on https://github.com/Zbyl/BFGFontTool by Zbyl): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P-o0gyZocH5oK_GIpT7TAr-Zzrs6w4Dl/view?usp=sharing

1. Install your favourite font (licensed or open source licensed; beware of "free" fonts found on the Net) into the system OS.
 
2. Generate bitmap font and image atlas using BMFont app (Bitmap Font Generator; v1.13 was tested) using settings file located in utils/BFGFont/bmfont_settings/ (don't forget to choose font)
 
3. Save bitmap font as "48", rename 48_0.tga into 48.tga and edit 48.fnt to adjust image name.
 
4. If there are 48_1, etc. image atlases present, adjust image resolution in BMFont settings - there can only be one atlas.
 
5. Run BFGFontTool 1.2 from utils/BFGFont/ and generate BFG font using .fnt file we just created 
 
6. Copy 48.dat, 48.tga, fontimage_12, _24, _48 into base/newfonts/fontname/ (fontname can contain smallletters, numbers and _ )
 
7. Rename fontimage_12, _24, _48 into old_12, _24, _48
 
8. Edit base/strings/english.lang and add definition for new fonts at the beginning of the file, after "#font_" line. For example, "#font_ubu"	"ubuntu". That will remap
font definition in .gui UI from [font "fonts/ubu"] to a new font "ubuntu". Note that "#font_XXXXX" seems to be currently limited to 5 symbols after "_".
